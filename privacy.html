    Privacy Policy for FallGuard
NEURON TS LABS Version: 2.0

Last Updated: February 4, 2026

1. OVERVIEW AND ACCEPTANCE
This Privacy Policy governs the "FallGuard" mobile application (the "App") developed by NEURON TS LABS. By installing and using this App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy. FallGuard is a safety utility designed to detect physical falls and alert emergency contacts.

2. SENSITIVE DATA AND PERMISSIONS (CRITICAL DISCLOSURE)
Google Play classifies certain permissions as "High Risk." FallGuard requires these to function as a life-safety tool.

A. Background Location Access
Purpose: FallGuard collects precise location data (GPS and network-based) to identify your coordinates.

Requirement: This data is collected even when the app is closed or not in use.

Use Case: If a fall is detected while the phone is in your pocket and the screen is off, the App must access your location in the background to include your "Help Link" in the emergency SMS.

Storage: We do not store your location history on any server. It is only used at the moment of a detected emergency.

B. SMS and Call Processing
SMS_SEND & SMS_RECEIVE: The App automatically sends a text message to your pre-defined contacts when a fall is confirmed.

CALL_PHONE: The App may initiate a voice call to ensure your emergency contact is alerted if they miss the SMS notification.

3. DATA MINIMIZATION AND SHARING
We follow a "Zero-Server" architecture for your personal safety data:

Third-Party Sharing: NEURON TS LABS does not sell, rent, or lease your data to third parties. We do not use your location for advertising or analytics.

Emergency Transmission: Your location and status are only shared with the specific individuals you have manually added to the "Emergency Contacts" list within the App.

Data Retention: All emergency contact numbers and user profiles are stored only on your local device. If you clear the App data or uninstall the App, this information is permanently deleted.

4. PROMINENT DISCLOSURE & USER CONSENT
Before the App begins monitoring for falls, you will be presented with a Prominent Disclosure screen.

You must click "I Agree" to acknowledge that you understand the App will monitor your location in the background.

You have the right to revoke these permissions at any time via Android Settings. However, revoking permissions will render the fall-detection and alerting system non-functional.

5. SECURITY MEASURES
We implement industry-standard encryption and security protocols to protect your local data. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your information, remember that no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure.

6. CHILDREN’S PRIVACY
Our services are not intended for individuals under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. In the case we discover that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we immediately delete this from our local records.

7. COMPLIANCE WITH GLOBAL STANDARDS
GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation): Users in the EU have the right to access, rectify, or delete their data. Since we store data locally, you can exercise these rights by managing the App's storage settings.

CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act): We do not "sell" personal information as defined by the CCPA.
