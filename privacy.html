    <h1>Privacy Policy for FallGuard</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> February 11, 2026</p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>NEURON TS LABS</strong> ("we," "us," or "our") handles your information through the <strong>FallGuard</strong> mobile application. Your privacy is our priority, and we have designed this app to operate with maximum transparency and minimum data collection.</p>

    <h2>1. PROMINENT DISCLOSURE & SENSITIVE PERMISSIONS</h2>
    <div class="highlight">
        <p><strong>Background Location Access:</strong> FallGuard requires access to your device's location at all times (including when the app is in the background or closed). This is strictly used to include your precise coordinates in emergency SMS alerts sent to your designated contacts after a fall is detected. This feature is the core functionality of the app.</p>
        
        <p><strong>SMS and Call Permissions:</strong> The app requires permission to send SMS messages and initiate phone calls. These actions are triggered automatically <em>only</em> when a fall is detected and the user fails to dismiss the alert within the grace period.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>2. DATA COLLECTION AND USE</h2>
    <p>We believe in <strong>Data Minimization</strong>. Here is how we handle your information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Personal Information:</strong> We do not require account registration. We do not collect your name, email address, or phone number for our own use.</li>
        <li><strong>Emergency Contacts:</strong> Contact details you select from your phone are stored locally on your device. We do not have access to these contacts.</li>
        <li><strong>Sensor Data:</strong> The app uses your device's accelerometer and gyroscope sensors to detect falls. This data is processed in real-time on your device and is never uploaded.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. DATA STORAGE & "ZERO-SERVER" ARCHITECTURE</h2>
    <p>FallGuard operates on a <strong>Zero-Server Architecture</strong>. This means:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your location data, emergency contact list, and app settings are stored <strong>only</strong> on your local device.</li>
        <li>We do not operate any external databases or cloud servers to store your sensitive personal data.</li>
        <li>No data is sold to, or shared with, third-party advertisers or data brokers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. THIRD-PARTY SERVICES</h2>
    <p>The app does not use third-party analytics or advertising SDKs that track your behavior. The only external communication occurs through your mobile carrier when sending emergency SMS or making calls as part of the app's core safety features.</p>

    <h2>5. CHILDREN'S PRIVACY</h2>
    <p>These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13.</p>

    <h2>6. SECURITY</h2>
    <p>Since your data stays on your device, its security depends on your device's security settings. We recommend using a screen lock and keeping your Android OS updated to protect the local data stored by FallGuard.</p>

    <h2>7. CHANGES TO THIS POLICY</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date at the top.</p>

    <h2>8. CONTACT US</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions or suggestions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at:</p>
